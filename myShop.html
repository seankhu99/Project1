	<h1>DIY Fingerboards</h1>
		<p>DIY Fingerboards is my little side shop that I run in my free time.</p>
		<p>First things first, a fingerboard is basically a miniature skateboard meant to be used with your fingers, hence the name</p>
		<p>My shop specializes is custom and premade 3d printed molds that allow for the creation of making your own wooden fingerboards</p>
		<p>My shop waas created due to a lack of a viable option for people to get affordable molds that anyone could buy on a whim.</p>
		<p>It was also created due to me getting burned badly in my journey for getting my own mold designed. The original designer messed up my mold and overcharged me for it. As the old saying goes, if you want something done right, sometimes you have to do it yourself</p>
		<p>It was a journey, I had to learn CAD software while figuring out if what I was modeling was even correct. It took me about 2 years of constanting prototyping before I finally nailed the design process to a science</p>
		<p>Truth be told there isn't a lot of money to be made in fingerboards. My shop came out of pure passion for the hobby and I wanted to spread that passion to others.</p>
